Using the codes for Part A and Part B are really simple, however this document will outline what needs to be known before running them.

First of all, the recuired modules should be installed, and without them the code wont work. They are slightly different from each other.
The paths for the inout files (the images and the excel document) are the same for both files and are noted in the comments in the code. They shouls be appropriately changed to 
the users file directory. 

To run Part A, a ram space of approximatelly 5400 MBs is needed. For Part B it is approxiamtelly 500 MBs. the code wont work without approriate ram space.
